    "In this programming assignment, you will create a simple search engine. More specifically, you will implement an index over a corpus of webpages, and also compress the index using variable length encoding. Both uncompressed and compressed indices will be tested on retrieval with Boolean conjunctive queries. The assignment is object-oriented and relies on python concepts such as functions, files and classes. Our TA, Makanjuola, has compiled a list of tutorials on these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A short video: [Learn python in 1 hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)\n",
    "2. [These docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) describe special functions such as `__getitem__` , etc. \n",
    "3. This [short tutorial](https://www.omkarpathak.in/2018/04/11/python-getitem-and-setitem/) is also useful to get started with special functions.\n",
    "4. Here is a very helpful tutorial on Python [file handling](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation).\n",
    "5. [This youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfcWRAxRVBA) and [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) can help get you started with Classes in Python.\n",
    "6. All tutorials (and more) are categorized in this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_aw1bW2Dx3eUMnlQLYl1p8iMyf4lXkBDjNfk688jHw/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

    "The HW is due **Wednesday, September 29, 2021 @ 11:59 pm**. You can form teams of two or work individually. Note that there exists no difference in terms of grading, i.e., we will grade the same for one and two person teams. Only one of the team members needs to submit the HW. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions on how to submit will be given soon. We will use an autograding system. Please do **NOT** change class and method names, otherwise autograding will fail. ONLY edit the parts with **\"### Begin your code\"** and **\"### End your code\"** comments. Note that all aspects of this assignment are covered by the [Honor Code](https://graduateschool.vt.edu/content/dam/graduateschool_vt_edu/graduate-honor-system/Constitution2021.pdf) and that the autograding system will also perform screening checks for code similarity. We will also inspect each student's code for implementation correctness. Finally, note that we will increase office hours before the HW deadline."

    "## Grading breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autograder (60%)**: To ensure your indices are built correctly, both the uncompressed and compressed index versions of your implementations will be tested on 20 Boolean conjunctive queries of one or multiple terms. For those queries, you will get 1.5% of the final grade for each query you answer correctly, for a total of 60% of your grade (30% for the compressed index and 30% for the uncompressed index). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Code inspection (40%)**: We will also grade each function implementation individually. The grading breakdown is as follows:\n",
    "1. `IdMap` - 4%\n",
    "2. `BSBIIndex parse_block` - 4%\n",
    "3. `InvertedIndexWriter append` - 2%\n",
    "4. `BSBIIndex invert_write` - 4%\n",
    "5. `InvertedIndexIterator` - 2%\n",
    "6. `BSBIIndex merge` - 4%\n",
    "7. `InvertedIndexMapper _get_postings_list` - 2%\n",
    "8. `sorted_intersect` - 4%\n",
    "9. `BSBIIndex retrieve` - 4%\n",
    "10. `CompressedPostings` - 4%\n",
    "11. Index size & Performance Questions (Q1-Q4) - 1.5% each question, for a total for 6% (4 x 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally note that in order to get full score:\n",
    "- The `retrieve` function should NOT load the whole index into memory  but rather load the postings lists of just the query terms.\n",
    "- The `merge` function should NOT load the complete intermediate indices or keep the whole merged index in memory.\n",
    "- The `retrieve` function should order the query terms by postings list length.\n",
    "- Both the `merge` function and the `sorted_intersect` function should NOT use the built in set operations  while merging postings lists or intersecting sorted lists.\n",
    "- Timings for the `retrieve` function should be within a time range. This will be ensured if you do NOT iterate through your index instead of seeking just the query terms, as this will significantly increase the time complexity. \n",
    "- Your compression algorithm should indeed achieve a compressed index, i.e., you should see a significant index size decrease."

To make the index more efficient, we can also represent terms as termIDs (unique serial numbers instead of strings).

    "However, we first implement the class `InvertedIndexWriter`, which provides an append function, just like appending to a list, with the difference that the postings_list isn't stored in memory but is directly written to disk. Next, we will add a function `invert_write` that inverts a block and writes it to disk. Inversion involves first sorting the termID-docID pairs and then collect all of pairs with the same termID into a postings list, where a posting is simply a docID. The result is an inverted index for the block, which is finally written to disk. You might find it helpful to read the [Python I/O docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) for information about appending to the end of a file."
